						"info_exposition": "how machine learning has been used to maximise recovery. Unlike conventional mine-to-mill studies based on disruptive site trials and expensive lab tests, machine learning based value chain optimisation uses gigabytes of historical data to predict, simulate and optimise both mining and processing. Machine learning algorithms continuously ‘learn’ from the geology, mining and plant data. The machine learning model maximises recovery by suggesting the processing plant sets points that historically achieved the highest recovery for the ore entering the plant (operational decision support). Recovery is maximised for the different ore characteristics entering the plant. In addition to the processing plant optimisation case study, a second geometallurgy case study from Ban Houaxai gold-silver operation in Loas will also be presented. The Ban Houayxai Gold-Silver Operation has experienced periods of lower than expected recoveries, with much of its gold locked inside sulphides and silicate minerals. Intermittent periods of low gold recoveries of less than 50 per cent have been experienced when head grades have been low and tails grades high. The machine learning model has been used to identify the areas that have possible problematic gold recovery. The MAXTA model has been tested to provide both a direct estimate of the tailings gold grade, as well as a probability that a block will have a high tails grade",
